This repository contains a small project I made for my university's Java course.

Subject: simulation of diving of a diving instructor with a group of students.

The project will eventually include several functionalities like:
- depth simulation,
- counting of gas consumption,
- communication: asking the amount of gas,
- possible further ideas :)

This is just an exercise of writing code in Java and does not reflect reality.

Greetings,
Kris
